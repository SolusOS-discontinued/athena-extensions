    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Writing a Athena-Python extension is a fairly straight-forward process.
    One simply imports the Athena module from the gobject introspection repository and creates a class which is derived from a gobject.GObject and 
    one of the Athena module's classes. When an extension derives a class, it becomes a "provider", 
    telling Athena to ask it for information. There are several types of providers 
    available for extensions to use: there is MenuProvider, LocationWidgetProvider, 
    ColumnProvider, PropertyPageProvider, and InfoProvider, all of which will be explained 
    in more detail below. Your class can be derived from multiple providers.</para>
    
    <para>Here are the basic steps:</para>
    
    <para>1. A script is written and installed to the standard athena-python extension install path</para>
    <para>2. Athena is (re)started and loads the athena-python C extension, which in turn loads all python extensions it can find</para>
    <para>3. Any python script in the standard athena-python extension install path that imports the Athena module from the gobject introspection repository and derives 
    the main class from a Athena module class will be loaded</para>
    
    <note>
<title>A note about the standard python extensions install path</title>

<para>As of athena-python 0.7.0 (and continued in 1.0+), athena-python looks in ~/.local/share/athena-python/extensions 
for local extensions and $PREFIX/share/athena-python/extensions for global extensions.</para>

    <note>
<title>A note about compatibility issues for athena-python 1.0</title>
    <para>1. We no longer support the "import athena" command that previous versions used.  This is because
    athena-python now directly uses Athena's annotations, which must be imported by the "from gi.repository import Athena" command.</para>
    <para>2. The extension class must now derive itself from a gobject.GObject in addition to the standard Athena classes.</para>
    <para>3. For now, some Athena class constructors require passing named arguments instead of a standard argument list.  This requirement may go away at some point.</para>
