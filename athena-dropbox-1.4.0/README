Building Dropbox Athena Extension From Source Tarball
--------------------------------------------------

You will need the following packages (or equivalent):

libathena-extension-dev

In the athena-dropbox dir just do:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

After installing the package you must restart Athena. You can do that by issuing the following command (note: if you're running compiz, doing so may lock up your computer - log out and log back in instead):

$ killall athena
